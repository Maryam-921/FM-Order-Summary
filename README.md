## My process
- i started with the card first, adding the image and text.
- net, i aligned the card to the center by setting its display to flex.
- then i set the sizes, aligned the text, and create boxes for annual plan and payment sections.
- setting the hover part was a challenge, but i did succeed after some research.
finally, i set the background color and image and it was completed.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Google fonts

### What I learned
I learned how to add background image using CSS, and also use hover property to change the color of the text depending on the position of the cursor.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  box-shadow: blue;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
